# SmartNotesAssistant

The goal of this personal project is to develop a simple AI-powered chat TUI (Terminal
User Interface) app that runs locally. Through a user-friendly interface
(`Textual`), you'll be able to create a vector database (using `Milvus` or
`Chroma` as the backend) to store your notes and interact with an LLM, which
will search your notes to provide answers.
